			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Former research shows that all of our interviewees were interested in video games, and in the recent research on the amount of people wearing glasses showed that the number of people wearing glasses are growing and the total number of pupils wearing glasses has approached 75% approximatetly so far("Research report with glasses", 2020). Besides,  among the 200 people who participated in the survey, 68% of the participants believed that playing games for a long time and staring at the electronic screen is very likely to cause myopia or deepen myopia. Therefore, the designed web is aimed to find a balance between real like and video games for those who were addicted and also provide a platform for them to make more friends.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Among young people ’s perception of game
addiction, the vast majority (about 80%) of
participants believe that people in the age group
of 13-25 are more likely to be addicted to games
than others, while 10% Think children under 13
are more addicted to games，and according to
the book CyberPsychology & Behaviour, game
addiction is related to the levels of social skills and
academic performance, which are all the things
that a teenager would need to face throughout
his(her) school life(Shao,2004,p.4) .Therefore,
combined with the our research we can found
that teenagers and even younger kids are more
likely to get addicted to video games.</p>
